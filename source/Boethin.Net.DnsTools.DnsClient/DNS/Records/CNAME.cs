    // 10.1.1. CNAME terminology
    //
    //    It has been traditional to refer to the label of a CNAME record as "a
    //    CNAME".  This is unfortunate, as "CNAME" is an abbreviation of
    //    "canonical name", and the label of a CNAME record is most certainly
    //    not a canonical name.  It is, however, an entrenched usage.  Care
    //    must therefore be taken to be very clear whether the label, or the
    //    value (the canonical name) of a CNAME resource record is intended.
    //    In this document, the label of a CNAME resource record will always be
    //    referred to as an alias.
